## üîç Prediction Usage

We provide an inference script `predict.py` that can perform property prediction on new molecules using pre-trained models (`model.pth`) saved from different cross-validation folds.

### ‚úÖ Script: `predict.py`

This script supports prediction using 10 saved models (one per fold), batch inference, and automatic evaluation if ground truth is provided.



### üß© Inputs

- `--property`: Name of the dataset (e.g., `corrosion`, `HIV`, etc.). This is used to locate the saved models under `./data/{property}/fold_*/model.pth`.
- `--smiles`: Path to a CSV file containing the SMILES strings to predict.  
  - **First column**: SMILES string  
  - **Second column (optional)**: Ground truth label(s), used to compute RMSE
- `--transformer`: Path to a `.npy` file containing 512-dimensional SMILES-based transformer features (same order as SMILES in CSV).
- `--output`: Path to save the prediction results in CSV format.
- `--batch_size` (optional): Batch size for inference. Default: `32`.



### üì§ Output

The output CSV file will contain:

- Original SMILES and (if provided) ground truth column(s)
- 10 new columns: `fold_0`, `fold_1`, ..., `fold_9` ‚Äî predictions from each fold model
- (Optional) RMSE printed to console if ground truth exists



### üß™ Example

```bash
python predict.py \
  --property corrosion \
  --smiles ./example.csv \
  --transformer ./example.npy \
  --output ./predicted_example.csv \
  --batch_size 32
